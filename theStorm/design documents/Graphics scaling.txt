Graphics scaling problem.
	If current window width is half of the original then everything on screen 	should be scaled by 0.5

	To get this, the scale factor (sf) would be 0.5

	A negative result would only be possible by dividing the smller number by 	bigger.

	Scale factor would be found by dividing the new ratio by the original.

	new = 1
	og = 2

	new/og = 0.5

Currently, every variable in the game is being scaled to the size of the screen. Eventually I will need to research a more streamlined way of achieving this, but for the simple game we are creating here, manual scaling will be good enough.
